## 6. Experience

There is some of my works: 

+  [Contact list application.](https://vadimromanovski.github.io/contacts/index.html)

   Each contact contains name and phone number. Above the list has input to filter contacts by name
(without button, each input of the user affects list immediately).
Each contact in the list has "remove" button which removes contact from the list.
Below the list "Add contact" button. If you press this button the changed to "/new-contact"(w/o page
reload) and form with two input(name, phone number) is displayed. Validation in place. If user fill the the
form and confirm page got redirected back to contact list with new contact.
